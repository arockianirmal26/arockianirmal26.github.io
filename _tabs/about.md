Hello, I'm Arockia NIRMAL Amala Doss, a data engineer with a passion for designing and building robust data solutions. With over 8 years of experience in database modeling, data warehousing, and ETL development, I specialize in creating efficient and scalable ETL/data pipelines.

I started my career as a database developer in India, where I honed my skills in SQL and database design. After completing my master's degree in Germany, I moved into the field of data engineering and have been working in this exciting and ever-evolving field ever since.

Over the past years, I've focused primarily on building ETL solutions, working with AWS to build and automate data pipelines. My goal as a data engineer is to help my clients unlock the power of their data. Whether you're looking to build a new data pipeline, optimize an existing system, or automate your data workflows, I have the skills and experience to help you achieve your goals.
